Draw a pie chart given a list of numbers. Numbers do not have be percentages of the pie. For example, if the user entered 10, 20, and 10, the chart would have 3 slices that covered 25%, 50%, and 25% of the pie. Each slice should have a different color, shading, or some easy way of identifying it.

Display a legend on the pie chart with each section labelled.
